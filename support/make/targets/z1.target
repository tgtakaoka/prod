# Old Z1, mspgccX (3.2.3) tool chain accepts -mdata-64k and -mcode-64k
# but new mspgcc4 (4.5.3+) doesn't understand these and causes the
# tinyos toolchain (nesc) to produce a really strange error:
#   "nesc1: internal error: couldn't define builtin macros - exiting"
#
# test the compiler to see if -mdata-64k is supported and if so tell it
# to put data into lower 64k.
#
# Backward compatibility.   Can eventually go away when the legacy toolchains
# are retired.
